      "(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n",

      "ü§ñ Assistant: Let‚Äôs start by thinking about the core elements:\n",

      "1. **Venue:** \n",
      " - If you‚Äôre holding the party at home, you‚Äôll save on venue costs. \n",
      " - If renting a space, you might need to allocate $100‚Äì$200 (depending on location and time of day).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Food:** \n",
      " - For 50 people, you could plan for about $2.50‚Äì$3.00 per person for finger foods, or $5‚Äì$7 per person for a sit-down meal. \n",
      " - Estimate $125‚Äì$350 for food.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Drinks:** \n",
      " - Soft drinks and water for all, maybe some alcoholic options if you want. \n",
      " - Budget $50‚Äì$100.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Decorations & Supplies:** \n",
      " - Balloons, banners, tableware, etc. \n",
      " - $30‚Äì$80.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Entertainment:** \n",
      " - Music (DJ, playlist, or playlist for 50), maybe a small activity or magician. \n",
      " - $50‚Äì$150.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Miscellaneous:** \n",
      " - Cleaning supplies, small gifts, favors, etc. \n",
      " - $20‚Äì$50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let‚Äôs try to balance these:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Finger Foods & Party Platters:** \n",
      " - Cheese and charcuterie boards can be made in advance and are a crowd-pleaser. \n",
      " - Fruit skewers, deviled eggs, mini quiches, and stuffed mushrooms are easy to prepare in bulk. \n",
      " - For a sweet touch, consider bite-sized desserts like mini cupcakes or cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Family-Style Meals:** \n",
      " - Large platters of nachos, tacos, or pizza can be shared easily. \n",
      " - Soup or salad bars let guests customize their portions and reduce waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Catering Packages:** \n",
      " - Some caterers offer buffet or family-style packages that are more affordable than individual plates. \n",
      " - Look for places that offer ‚Äúmix-and-match‚Äù menus or ‚Äúfood truck‚Äù style options.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Self-Prep & Delivery:** \n",
      " - If you have help, you can prepare some dishes at home and take them to the venue. \n",
      " - Local food delivery services (like ‚Äúfood trucks‚Äù or large-format meal kits) can be a cost-effective alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Budget Tips:** \n",
      " - Buy in bulk and freeze what you can. \n",
      " - Plan the menu a few weeks ahead to get better pricing. \n",
      " - Ask if your venue can accommodate food deliveries, so you don‚Äôt have to pay for a separate caterer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to personalize the menu, you can adjust these options. And remember, the goal is to create a fun, memorable experience for everyone‚Äîfood is just one part of that. If you need more specific recommendations (like recipes or vendors), just let me know!\n",
